#Automation Coding Exercise 


##Prerequisites

Create a new account on the MuleSoft website. (any email address can be used for registration).

##Goal
For this exercise we would like to create automated tests for the MuleSoft home page.


The first functionality to cover is the “login” experience. For this, you must not automate the sign up/registration process.

Next, we need to validate MuleSoft home page contents to ensure that correct information is being displayed 
(analyze and check which contents are worth automating).

On the other hand, we want to validate our search function. 
In this case it is required that it works correctly for the following search terms: “trial”, “api”.

Another important feature is to validate MuleSoft product download page functionality 
(https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio). In this case, it is only needed to check that we can trigger the download 
for any operating system. It is not required to check the downloaded file.


Note: Please feel free to add any validations you consider important for any of the previous requirements.

##Requirements

Develop an application using the corresponding frameworks to generate the mentioned automated tests. 
Attached you will find an example application which uses Selenium as a framework, 
it is not required to use it specifically but it is just meant to be a guide to start with.

Handle reporting of automated tests results as you feel it is necessary. 
These results may be used to report webpage status.

Usage of testing design patterns will be evaluated and considered.

Send the project vía Github or Zip file through an email to the recruiter assigned.
